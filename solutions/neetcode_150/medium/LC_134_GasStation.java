/*
 * LeetCode Problem 134: Gas Station
 * URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/
 * Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * Approach:
 * - If total gas is less than total cost, it's impossible â†’ return -1.
 * - Traverse the array, maintaining:
 *   - totalSum: total gas - total cost (to check if a solution is possible)
 *   - currSum: current segment sum from the candidate starting index
 *   - startIndex: candidate index where we might start the trip
 * - If currSum becomes negative, reset the start index to i + 1 and currSum to 0.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
